# AGENTS.md — ags-wallpaper-selector operating contract

Canonical agent instructions for this repo. Claude (`CLAUDE.md` symlinks here),
OpenCode and every BMAD/OpenSpec skill must follow this.

## 1. Evidence rule (hard requirement)

No suggestion "in the air". Every technical claim, recommendation or design
decision carries testable evidence: a file path + line range, a commit SHA, a
URL + quoted section, or an executed command with its result.

Format: non-trivial claims get `Evidence:` and `Verify:` lines. If evidence
does not exist yet, write `Evidence: MISSING — run <X>` and do not present the
claim as fact. Prefer executed output over recalled text.

## 2. What this repo is

`ags-wallpaper-selector` is the standalone wallpaper selector extracted from
`ags-apps` v0.5.0. The repo root **is** the app package: `app.tsx` lives at the
root, never in a subdirectory.

Identity is single-valued and enforced by `app.manifest.json`:

```text
app=wallpaper-selector  instance=wallpaper-selector
configDir=ags-wallpaper-selector
mode=live               holdsUnsavedState=false
```

- Window: `wallpaper-selector-window`; launcher: `wallpaper-selector-ui`;
  keybind description: “Open wallpaper selector” (SUPER+W).
- No app imports another app. Depend on `ags-platform` (and `contracts` at test
  time only), never on a sibling app repo.
- The runtime is the only palette-refresh trigger. Do not subscribe to
  `wallpaper.state` for palette application and do not invent a palette event.
  `wallpaper.state` is progress/busy status only.

## 3. Ticket flow

All work starts as a ticket in `tickets/` (`_template/`, vocab + rollup in
`INDEX.md`, flow in `LIFECYCLE.md`). App-local work is ticketed here; cross-app
program work stays in `ags-apps` until archive.

Never work on main: `scripts/worktree-guard.sh check-clean` before starting and
`scripts/worktree-guard.sh create <id> <slug>` to branch + worktree. Record
`worktree=` and `branch=` in the ticket. Keep changes small, verifiable and
committable; never mix planning edits with implementation in one turn.

## 4. Local gates vs stock CI

**Local is authoritative for typecheck.** CI runs only stock-runner jobs
(`ubuntu-latest`): `make test`, `make conformance` and `make drift`. There is
no self-hosted runner and no CI secret dependency.

- `make test` — pure unit tests, the selector model and the BUG-002
  Apply-collapse gate. Node only; nothing imports `gi://*` or `ags/*`.
- `make conformance` — manifest identity, live handler and template gate.
- `make drift` — shared event client against the canonical `contracts` tuple.
- `make typecheck` — LOCAL: needs `ags` on PATH plus GIR/Astal; generates
  machine-specific `@girs/` and `env.d.ts` (gitignored).
- `make bundle` — LOCAL: `ags bundle app.tsx build/ags-wallpaper-selector.js`.
- `make gates` — all of the above.

The program tuple is `ags-platform` / `contracts` v0.3.0, local-only in this
run. `.dev/` is gitignored; never commit a fetched platform, `node_modules/`,
`@girs/`, generated `tsconfig.json` or bundle output.

## 5. Live refresh invariants

`lib/palette-refresh.ts` and `lib/appearance.ts` are pure and executed by tests:

- exactly one JSON-string response per request, through the platform helper;
- idempotent by appearance hash; a thrown refresh is not recorded as applied;
- the Theme pointer is re-applied before the search icon is rebuilt;
- the drawer is preserved: no rescan, no query reset, no selection change, no
  visibility change, no status rewrite, no model reload.

This is the real v0.5.0 handler. `make conformance` asserts these source
invariants and the platform `checkAppRepo` template gate. Do not weaken them to
make a test pass.

## 6. Release

Releases are immutable annotated tags (`v0.1.0`, …). A published tag is never
moved. Installed tags are read-only; writable state lives under XDG paths, never
inside the tag. Tag only after `make gates` passes, and record the evidence in
the release ticket.
